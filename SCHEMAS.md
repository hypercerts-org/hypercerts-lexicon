## Notes

- All timestamps use the `datetime` format (ISO 8601)
- Strong references (`com.atproto.repo.strongRef`) include both the URI and CID of the referenced record
- Union types allow multiple possible formats (e.g., URI or blob)
- Array items may have constraints like `maxLength` to limit the number of elements
- String fields may have both `maxLength` (bytes) and `maxGraphemes` (Unicode grapheme clusters) constraints
