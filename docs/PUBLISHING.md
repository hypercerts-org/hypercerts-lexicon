# Publishing Guide for Maintainers

This document describes how to publish the `@hypercerts-org/lexicon`
package to npm using GitHub Actions workflows with Changesets. The
workflow uses separate branches for beta and stable releases, with all
releases manually triggered to give you full control over when releases
are made.

## Branch Strategy

- **`develop` branch**: Beta/prerelease versions
- **`main` branch**: Stable releases

**Suggested Flow:** `feature` → `develop` (beta) → `main` (stable)

**Note:** Direct development on `main` is also supported. The `develop` → `main` flow is suggested when you want to publish beta versions for testing before stable releases. If you work directly on `main`, you can skip the beta testing phase and go straight to stable releases.

## Prerequisites

Before publishing, ensure you have:

1. **npm Trusted Publisher configured:**
   - The workflow uses npm Trusted Publishers via GitHub OIDC for secure,
     token-less publishing
   - Configure on npmjs.com: Package settings → Publishing access → Add a
     GitHub Actions publisher
   - **Required settings:**
     - Organization/User: `hypercerts-org`
     - Repository: `hypercerts-lexicon`
     - Workflow filename: `release.yml` (must match exactly, case-sensitive)
   - The npm CLI (v11.5.1+) automatically detects OIDC and uses it
   - See: <https://docs.npmjs.com/trusted-publishers>
   - **No `NPM_TOKEN` secret is required** - Trusted Publishers eliminates
     the need for long-lived tokens

2. **Repository URL in package.json:**
   - `package.json` must have a `repository.url` field
   - This is required for npm Trusted Publishers to verify the package source
   - The repo already has this configured correctly

## Adding Changesets

Before publishing, you need to create changesets for any user-facing
changes:

```bash
npm run changeset
```

This will:

1. Prompt you to select which packages changed
2. Ask for the version bump type (major/minor/patch)
3. Create a markdown file in `.changeset/` with your changes

**Note:** Changesets generates files with random names (e.g.,
`beige-clowns-relax.md`). This is intentional to prevent filename
collisions when multiple contributors create changesets simultaneously.
The filename doesn't affect version ordering—Changesets uses git history
to determine the order of changes. You can rename these files if desired,
but it's not necessary.

## Publishing a Stable Release

**If merging from `develop` → `main`:** Before merging, you must exit prerelease mode on the `develop` branch:

```bash
# On develop branch
npm run changeset pre exit
git add .changeset/pre.json
git commit -m "chore: exit prerelease mode"
git push
```

This sets the exit intent in `pre.json`, which is required before merging to `main`. The PR check will verify this.

**If working directly on `main`:** You can skip this step since `pre.json` won't exist.

To publish a stable release to npm:

1. **If merging from `develop` → `main`:**
   - Run `npm run changeset pre exit` on `develop` branch
   - Commit and push the change
   - Merge `develop` → `main` (the PR check will verify exit intent)

   **If working directly on `main`:**
   - Skip this step and proceed to step 2

2. **Run the workflow:**
   - Navigate to: <https://github.com/hypercerts-org/hypercerts-lexicon/actions/workflows/release.yml>
   - Click "Run workflow"
   - Select the branch: **`main`** (the workflow automatically detects this is a stable release)
   - Click "Run workflow" to start

3. **What happens:**
   - The workflow validates the code and regenerates TypeScript types
   - If `pre.json` exists (from `develop`), verifies that prerelease mode has been exited
   - If there are pending changesets, it creates a "Release Pull Request"
   - The Release PR will remove prerelease tags (if any) and exit prerelease mode
   - Merge the Release PR to publish to npm with the `latest` tag
   - If no changesets exist, nothing is published

## Publishing a Beta Release

To publish a beta/prerelease version:

1. **Run the workflow:**
   - Navigate to: <https://github.com/hypercerts-org/hypercerts-lexicon/actions/workflows/release.yml>
   - Click "Run workflow"
   - Select the branch: **`develop`** (the workflow automatically detects this is a beta release)
   - Click "Run workflow"

2. **What happens:**
   - The workflow validates the code and regenerates TypeScript types
   - Enters beta prerelease mode (if not already) and commits `pre.json` to `develop`
   - Versions packages based on pending changesets
   - Publishes to npm with the `beta` tag
   - Version format: `0.9.0-beta.1`, `0.9.0-beta.2`, etc.
   - Commits and pushes version changes back to the `develop` branch

**Note:** Beta releases run on the `develop` branch, so no `RELEASE_PAT` is needed (unlike protected `main` branch).

## Validating Releases (PRs)

When you open a pull request to `main`, the "PR Check" workflow automatically
runs to:

- Check if package changes (lexicons, types, package.json) have
  corresponding changesets
- Warn if changesets are missing
- **Reject the PR if `pre.json` exists without exit intent** - This only applies
  when merging from `develop` to `main`. It ensures prerelease mode has been
  properly exited before merging. Direct work on `main` doesn't have `pre.json`,
  so this check is skipped.

This helps ensure all user-facing changes are properly documented and that
prerelease mode is correctly managed when using the `develop` → `main` flow.

## Version Management

Versions are determined by Changesets:

- **Patch**: Bug fixes and minor updates (0.9.0 → 0.9.1)
- **Minor**: New features (0.9.0 → 0.10.0)
- **Major**: Breaking changes (0.9.0 → 1.0.0)

You specify the version bump type when creating a changeset with
`npm run changeset`.

The `prepublishOnly` script ensures types are regenerated before
publishing, so the published package always includes the latest
generated TypeScript types.
